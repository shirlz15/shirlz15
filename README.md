## 👋 Hi, I'm Shirley S

**First-year B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student | Class of 2029**

- 🧱 Team lead for a **Brick Breaker Game in C**, where I coordinated tasks and implemented features like Ghost Mode, color selection, collision handling, and rule-based score feedback  
- 🌐 Built **FitRegion**, a fitness & diet planning web application using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with BMI-based workouts and region-aware Indian diets  
- 🗂️ Developed a **Student Record Management System in C**, focusing on structured data storage, search functionality, and clean documentation  
- 🌱 Currently strengthening my fundamentals in **C programming, web technologies, and problem-solving**

### ⚡ Fun fact
I enjoy breaking down complex logic into simple steps—especially when debugging C programs late at night 😄
